🔍 Problem Statement
In the highly competitive mobile market, businesses struggle to:

Understand which mobile brands and models perform best in different regions.

Track daily/monthly sales trends and predict future demand.

Analyze customer buying patterns and preferences.

Identify top-performing cities and optimize inventory and marketing spend.

Raw data alone doesn’t reveal these patterns clearly. There’s a strong need for an interactive dashboard to help sales managers and business heads take real-time, data-driven decisions.





✅ Business Solution
This dashboard provides:

A comprehensive view of sales KPIs like revenue, units sold, ratings, and average selling price.

Insights into top-performing brands, cities, and mobile models.

Customer behavior analysis based on age, payment method, and product preference.

Time-series analysis to track performance over specific dates, weekdays, and months.




📈 The dashboard allows decision-makers to:

Allocate marketing budgets to high-performing regions.

Identify underperforming brands/models and take corrective actions.

Understand customer preferences by age, payment method, and location.

Improve demand forecasting and inventory management.


🔍 Insights You Can Draw
📍 Which city has the highest revenue?

📈 Which brand is growing the fastest?

⭐ Which models are most liked (based on ratings)?

💳 What’s the most popular payment method?
